It provides detailed information about each martial art, including its history, basic techniques, and the differences between various styles. The website is intended to be an easy-to-use and engaging reference for martial arts enthusiasts and beginners who want to learn more about these disciplines.

### Project Contents:

- **index.html**: The main homepage of the website, containing a paragraph about martial arts and thier history.

3. **Readable Layout**: Consistent colors and clear fonts make the content easy to read.  
4. **Interactive Elements**: Some pages contain images that can be enlarged or collapsible lists for detailed information.

### Design Decisions:

- I chose to create a separate page for each martial art to make navigation simpler, instead of putting all content on a single long page.  
- The website uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to simplify the project and meet CS50 requirements without relying on complex databases.  
- A simple and functional design was preferred to focus on educational content rather than heavy visual effects.

### How to Use:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.  
2. Press to Styles button in the navbar.  
3. You will be directed to the specific page, where you will see all of styles that are in the website.
4. Then you can press to "learn more" button and you will redirct to the information page of that martial art style

### Challenges Faced:

- Collecting accurate and reliable information about each martial art.  
- Organizing content in a way that is easy to navigate.  
- Ensuring the website works consistently across different browsers and devices.

**Martial Arts Encyclopedia** is an educational project that aims to provide valuable and enjoyable content for martial arts enthusiasts worldwide. It can be further enhanced in the future by adding more interactive features, such as video tutorials or basic movement simulations for each martial art.
